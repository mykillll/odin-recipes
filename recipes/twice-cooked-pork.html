            <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
            <ul>    
                <li>1 pound of pork belly</li>
                <li>2 slice of ginger</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons of spicy bean paste</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>2 long hot green peppers</li>
                <li>1 medium leek</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of shaoxing wine</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the whole piece of pork belly and the ginger, and bring the pot to a boil again.<br> Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, until the pork is tender and cooked through. Remove the pork from the pot and run it under<br> cold running water for about a minute. Set aside.</li>
                <li>While the pork is cooling, prepare all the other ingredients. Once you are ready to cook (don't do this in advance, or the pork will dry out),<br> thinly slice the pork belly (slices should be about 1/8 inch thick).</li>
                <li>Heat your wok over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and sear the pork, until you get a light caramelization,<br> about 90 seconds. Turn the heat to medium-low and scoop out the pork. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok.</li>
                <li>Add the spicy broad bean paste to the wok and let it fry in the oil for about 30 seconds to bring out the flavor and color. The color should<br> be red; pay attention to the heat to avoid burning.</li>
                <li>Now add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Turn the heat to high and add the pork, peppers, and leeks. Stir-fry for a minute. Add the shaoxing<br> wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Stir everything together. Once the leeks and are wilted and the peppers are cooked (while still having<br> a little crunch), <strong>it's ready to serve.</strong></li>
